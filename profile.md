👋 Welcome to TriviumTech's GitHub!
Hi, I'm a confessional Lutheran educator and tech enthusiast, shaping young minds through classical education and modern technology. As a K–8 technology instructor at Creekside Christian School and founder of Trivium Polytechnic, I blend the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) with STEM to foster truth, vocation, and exploration for grades 5–12.
🌟 Current Focus: Building project-based learning (PBL) experiences that empower gifted students with Socratic dialogue, coding, and engineering skills, all rooted in Christian encouragement.

📖 About Me
I’m passionate about nurturing curious scholars who think deeply and create purposefully. With over a decade in education, I teach technology at Creekside Christian School in Custer, SD, and run Trivium Polytechnic, a microschool offering enrichment courses in philosophy, logic, coding, and more. My approach combines classical Lutheran values with hands-on tech projects, preparing students for meaningful vocations.

Teaching Philosophy: Education is mentorship, not manufacturing. I guide students to discover truth through dialogue and real-world projects.
Mission: To form scholars who serve faithfully in home, church, and community, equipped with wisdom and technical skills.


🚀 Current Projects
Trivium Polytechnic Website (In Progress)
A single-page React + Tailwind CSS website mockup for my microschool, showcasing summer enrichment courses (e.g., Code & Reason, Latin I) and the Creekside Tech Program. Designed for homeschoolers and private schools, it’s a static prototype for future GitHub Pages hosting.

Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, JavaScript (via CDNs)
Features: Course catalog, mock registration, student dashboard
Status: Local mockup, preparing for custom domain (triviumpolytechnic.org)

Creekside Tech Program: Logos Technê Cohort
A PBL curriculum for grades 5–8, featuring 4-week tech modules (e.g., Scratch storytelling, Tinkercad robotics) with oral presentations. Integrated into the Trivium Polytechnic website, it reflects my daily work at Creekside Christian School.

Tools: Scratch, Tinkercad, CoSpaces, Code.org, Google Suite, Typetastic
Goal: Empower students with coding, logic, and rhetorical skills through Lutheran-themed projects.
